/*
 * -------------------------------------------
 *  NOTE: This test behaves differenly on 9.5
 * -------------------------------------------
 *
 * Also since 8edd0e794 (>= 12) Append nodes with single subplan are eliminated,
 * causing different output. Moreover, again since 12 (608b167f9f), CTEs which are
 * scanned once are no longer an optimization fence, changing a good deal of
 * plans here. There is an option to forcibly make them MATERIALIZED, but we
 * also need to run tests on older versions, so put updated plans in
 * pathman_upd_del_2.out instead.
