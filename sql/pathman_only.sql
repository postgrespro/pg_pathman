/*
 * ---------------------------------------------
 *  NOTE: This test behaves differenly on PgPro
 * ---------------------------------------------
 *
 * Since 12 (608b167f9f), CTEs which are scanned once are no longer an
 * optimization fence, which changes practically all plans here. There is
 * an option to forcibly make them MATERIALIZED, but we also need to run tests
 * on older versions, so create pathman_only_1.out instead.
 *
 * Since 55a1954da16 and 6ef77cf46e8 (>= 13) output of EXPLAIN was changed,
 * now it includes aliases for inherited tables.
